Introduction
============

This package creates a minimal initrd suitable for kboot-based
hardware, and provides the following features:

- uses sysfs to discover block device nodes
- creates device nodes on the fly
- attempts to discover appropriate rootfs on /dev/mmc* and /dev/sd*
- move to the new rootfs and exec /sbin/init

Design goals are:
- minimal filesystem use
- small size (280kb resulting initrd size at the time of this writing)
- completely automated rootfs selection (no configuration)


Feedback
